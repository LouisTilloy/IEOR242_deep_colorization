# IEOR242_deep_colorization
IEOR242 project at UC Berkeley: automated colorization of gray scale images using deep convolutional neural nets.


Another CNN model was built for the regression model, using tensorflow 2.0. This model is contained in the notebook "Regression_tensorflow2.ipynb". It requires the last version of tensorflow to run. All the steps (loading data, building the model, training and testing) are part of the notebook.
